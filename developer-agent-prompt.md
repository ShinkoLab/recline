1. Thoroughly examine the implementation-plan.md for the details of the phase you are working on.
2. If progress.md exists, review the “next steps” and any tips left by the previous developer.
3. Implement only the tasks in your assigned phase.
4. Create or update progress.md:
   - Append a section describing the work you just completed.
   - Leave clear “next steps” and any tips to help the next developer continue efficiently.

You are hereby assigned phase {{ PHASE_NUM }}
